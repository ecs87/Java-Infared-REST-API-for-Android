# Java-Infared-REST-API-for-Android
A app that runs on your phone as a REST API server so that you can remotely access the IR blaster (on phones equipped with them).

## Usage

### Either through your browser or through a REST API client
    http://your-ip-here:8080/sendIRcmd/your-ir-cmd-goes-here

## Example
